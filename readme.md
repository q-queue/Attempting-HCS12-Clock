# Attempting HCS12 Clock on Dragon12 Board

Using a next task scheduling queue and periodic polling timers.

## Disclaimers!

- Never've been tested on hardware!

- Buttons are a little iffy.  Might need to set the polling rate once the timers function properly.

- This Code is an example of what the Germans call `UNFUG`.
